# Trust

## Summary

Trust is a Windower 4 addon for FFXI that turns your character into a Trust. It works for all jobs and can attack, nuke, pull, skillchain and more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Support

Get help or request a feature in the [Cyrite Game Studios Discord](https://discord.gg/rUa52rWK). Do NOT ask questions about Trust in game.

## Setup

You will need the latest version of [Trust](https://github.com/cyritegamestudios/trust) in order to use Trust. You will need to update *both* the `addons` and `cylibs` repo when you pull new changes, as `addons` is powered by `cylibs` and will not work properly if the versions don't match.

1. Git clone or download [Trust](https://github.com/cyritegamestudios/trust) from Github.
2. Copy the `addons` folder into your `Windower` folder so that you are pasting the new `addons` folder on top of your existing `addons` folder. Note that this will *not* override your entire existing `addons` folder, only addons related to Trust.
3. Double check that the `Windower/addons/Trust` folder exists.
5. Double check that the `Windower/addons/libs/cylibs` folder exists.
6. Run `// lua r trust` and you're ready to get started!

## Updates

To update Trust, either do a `git pull --rebase` or follow the steps above again.

### Optional

6. Override [job settings](#job-settings) to customize what your trust does.

## Dependencies

Trust also requires the following libraries and addons:
* Shortcuts
* Gearswap (vanilla or Selendrile)

## Modes

Trusts uses Modes inspired by GearSwap to control Trust behavior. For example,
`AutoPullMode` controls whether the Trust should pull mobs:

`state.AutoPullMode = M{['description'] = 'Auto Pull Mode', 'Off', 'Auto'}`

When set to `Auto`, the Trust will automatically start pulling mobs specified in
the `battle_targets` list in settings.xml.

To cycle between Modes:

`// trust cycle AutoPullMode`

To set the value of a Mode directly:

`// trust set AutoPullMode Auto`

There are over a dozen configurable Modes. To see the full list of Modes available on your current job:

`// trust status`

## Settings

Settings determine the behavior of a Trust and can be configured in two different ways:

### Job Settings

These settings are job-specific settings and can be found in the
`Trust/data` folder (e.g. `RDM.lua`, `PUP.lua`, `WAR.lua`). These files specify behavior for their respective jobs. 
For example, settings in `RDM.lua` have two lists, `SelfBuffs` and `PartyBuffs`. Changing the values in these lists will 
change what buffs the RDM Trust applies to itself and its party.

Below are some examples of job-specific settings that can be configured:

| Syntax                                          | Example                                               | Description                                                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Spell.new(spell_name, job_abilities, job_names) | Spell.new('Refresh', L{'Composure'}, L{'BLU', 'WHM'}) | Casts a spell. Optionally uses a job ability before casting the spell. Optionally limits to specific jobs.  |
| Buff.new(buff_name, job_abilities, job_names)   | Buff.new('Refresh', L{}, L{'DRK','PUP','PLD'})        | Same as Spell, but automatically determines the highest tier version of the buff the Trust is able to cast. |

Click on the [wiki doc](../../libs/cylibs/doc/modules/Spell.html) in your local file browser for a more detailed description of spells and buffs.

You can customize these settings by forking off of the default settings using the following command:

`// trust create JOB_NAME_SHORT`, e.g. `// trust create RDM`. This will create a copy of the default settings file with the format
`JOB_NAME_SHORT_character_name.lua`, e.g. `RDM_Avesta.lua`. Job settings will now reference this file instead while
you are on that character.

### Mode Settings

These settings are Mode-specific settings and can be found in the `Trust/data/modes` folder. You can use these to store values of Modes (e.g. `AutoBuffMode`, `AutoPullMode`, etc.) so you don't have to reset them every
time you reload the `Trust` addon. Default configurations are provided for each job and will *automatically load* when
loading the addon.

You can customize the default modes for a job by forking off of the default configuration:

Change your settings using the [modes commands](#command-list) and type `// trust save`. This will create a new copy of the modes configuration file with the format `JOB_NAME_SHORT_character_name.lua`, e.g. `RDM_Avesta.lua`. Modes configuration will now reference this file instead while
you are on that character. To save a new configuration instead of overriding the default configuration for the job, type `// trust save mode_name`, e.g. `// trust save Dynamis`.

You can cycle through all Mode settings for a job using `// trust cycle TrustMode`.

To see the full list of Modes availabile on the player's current job, use `// trust status`.

You can combine these modes to customize Trust behavior. For example, to make your Trust assist a player named Jerry and automatically engage and approach the mob:

* `// trust assist Jerry`
* `// trust set AutoEngageMode Always`
* `// trust set CombatMode Melee`

## Remote Commands
You can execute commands remotely on a player using Trust. This allows you to do things like add yourself to the player's party, even if they are AFK.

### Whitelist
For safety reasons, you must be in a player's remote command whitelist in order to execute remote commands on their player. Additionally, there is a strict list of commands that are able to be executed.

### Remote Command List
To send a remote command, send the player a tell with one of the following commands.

| Command                            | Action                                                      |
|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Any [Trust command](#command-list) | E.g. `trust start`, `trust stop`.                           |
| /pcmd add player_name              | Adds a player to the party, e.g. `/pcmd add Jerry`.         |
| /pcmd remove player_name           | Removes a player from the party, e.g. `/pcmd remove Jerry`. |
| /warp                              | Warps (requires Gearswap warp ring/cudgel shortcut).        |
| /refa, /refa all                   | Dismisses a player's trusts.                                |

You can combine these commands to control another player's actions using Trust. For example, if you wanted to join a party, you would do:

* `/t Ashylarry trust stop`
* `/t Ashylarry /refa all`
* `/t Ashylarry /pcmd add Jerry` (requires autojoin)
* `/t Ashylarry trust start`
